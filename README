# Socket Deno 🔌🦕

## Overview

This is a simple WebSocket chat application template built with Deno 🦕 and the Oak 🐿️. It provides a starting point for developing real-time chat applications using WebSockets.

## Features

- Real-time messaging using WebSockets
- Supports multiple chat rooms
- Displays online users in each room
- Powered by Deno and the Oak web framework

## Getting Started

### Setup on Render

**Deno**: The project uses Deno as the runtime. It's automatically installed during the build process.

The following environment variable and commands are required for setting up and running the project on Render:

- **Environment Variable**:

  - `DENO_INSTALL` should be set to `/opt/render/project/.deno`.

- **Build Command**:  
  This command installs Deno on the Render platform:

  ```sh
  curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
  ```

- **Start Command**:  
  This command sets up the environment and starts the application:
  ```sh
  export PATH="$DENO_INSTALL/bin:$PATH" && deno run --allow-net --allow-read server.js
  ```

### Local Development

If you want to run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install [Deno](https://deno.land/) on your machine.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/socket-deno-template.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd socket-deno-template
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read server.js
   ```

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can connect to the WebSocket server using a client (e.g., a web browser or a WebSocket client tool). The application supports basic real-time messaging.

### Deployment

To deploy the application on Render:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Connect the repository to your Render account.
3. Configure the environment variable and commands as described above.
4. Deploy your service.
